					<h3>Mission, Vision And History of New Hope</h3>
				
					<p>New Hope housing is a Houston based non-profit organization. Their core purpose is to stabilize lives through quality, affordable housing in a supportive and dignified environment. New Hope addresses the single room occupancy (SRO) housing crisis in Houston by providing a 
practical and demonstrated solution to prevent homelessness.</p>
						<p>New Hope was incorporated in 1993 with seed money raised by the People of Christ Church Cathedral-Episcopal. Today, New Hope is a non-profit supportive housing developer operating to standards of the quality multifamily industry, with the efficiency of the private sector. For nearly two decades, New Hope has carried forward the Cathedral’s vision of serving 
							disadvantage and homeless Houstonians both in the Cathedral’s downtown vicinity and throughout Houston. Since inception, New Hope has offered high quality permanent, supportive, affordable SRO housing to more than 7,000 people, many who ultimately move to market-rate housing or reconnect with family.</p>
						<p>New Hope is widely recognized as having established the model for SRO housing in the State of Texas. Their award-winning apartment communities are developed with attention to cost efficient design and long-term sustainability. New Hope’s program is two-fold: (1) the affordable 
housing they offer that stabilizes lives; and, (2) the resident services that complement the housing component to help residents remain housed. It is not enough to simply place these individuals in housing. They must be equipped with the resources and tools to remain in stable housing, tools that serve as the frontline in preventing homelessness.
</p>
<p>New Hope’s Board is committed to the development and operation of ~1,000 SRO units by ~2014. In 2010, New Hope effectively doubled in size – moving closer to their goal of providing 1,000 units of SRO housing. They grew from an organization with 319 units of SRO housing at three properties to an organization with 634 units at five properties – serving a vital community need. Support from their donors has helped move New Hope from being a nonprofit organization building one property at a time to a nonprofit developer with a more reliable development cycle and with two or more projects in varying stages of development simultaneously.</p>
<p>
Today, New Hope has 320 additional units of affordable housing (two 160-unit projects) under development. Therefore, as the number of units they provide continues to increase, the services they offer their residents must maintain equal pace. There is a dire need in Houston for more than 8,000 units of permanent supportive housing, whereas today only ~1,400 exist, and social services are struggling to keep up. This means that – more than ever – New Hope needs assistance from private donors to ensure they maintain the same supportive environment at each New Hope property. And, New Hope is the only affordable housing developer with an assertive, concrete plan to increase Houston’s stock of 
permanent, supportive SRO housing.</p>

<h3>Green Innovations</h3>
	<p>New Hope has recently established a new green standard. One of the three properties that opened in 2010—2424 Sakowitz—is the first LEED (Leadership in Environmental & Energy Design) certified affordable housing in Texas. The Sakowitz property is also Houston’s first ‘green’ multifamily housing development. The fact that this building is ‘supportive’ housing and that it has achieved platinum certification – the highest level – makes this distinction even more significant.</p>
	<p>The construction of Sakowitz established a new model for New Hope. From this point forward, we will continue to set the standard for affordable housing providers, and all of New Hope’s properties will be energy efficient, ‘green’ buildings. The operating costs of energy efficient buildings are much lower than non-green properties. Building green allows New Hope to maintain rental rates well below market rate, thus improving our delivery of services to the poor. Additionally, upon move-in, residents are provided ‘green’ training in order to become more environmentally conscientious about their surroundings.</p>
	<p>New Hope’s enduring ‘green’ building design is created through a process that includes: owner, architect, contractor, landscape architect, craftsmen, engineers, and community participants. The ‘green’ properties will prove durable, resource efficient, and cost effective to operate, with materials of above-average quality used for maintenance efficiency. Lower energy and maintenance expenditures – via green construction – allow New Hope to offer life-stabilizing, quality housing at a more stable rental rate. For New Hope, being ‘green’ displays our continued commitment as the lifetime owner of our properties – properties that need sustainable features to endure as community assets.</p>
	<p>Our green initiatives include:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li> Smart site location and design</li>
    		<li>Building orientation designed for day lighting and shading</li>
   		<li> Very high density development – 90 units/acre</li>
