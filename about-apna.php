				<h3>History</h3>
								
				<div class="col-md-9">
					<p>APNA Energy, established in 2006, is a privately owned, successful retail electric provider. We offer service to all deregulated areas across the State of Texas. With corporate offices in Southwest Houston, our portfolio consists of small, medium and large commercial facilities located throughout the deregulated areas of Texas. We also pride ourselves and servicing thousands of Residential customers across Texas. Our Board of Directors consists of individuals who own companies within the industrial, software- hardware distribution and wholesale-Retail industry.</p>
					<h4>Key Accomplishments and APNA Energy Community Investments</h4>
					<p>Due to APNAʼs solid customer service, low electricity rate, and community involvement, APNA was awarded a prestigious Proclamation by the Mayor of Houston. The Proclamation designated April 10th as ʻAPNA Energy Dayʼ. We take great pride in our positive reputation among our customers and our ʻAʼ Rating with the BBB. Seeking to become more involved in our community, we launched the ʻAPNA Energy Community Outreach Programʼ in January 2011 now “Apna Cares”. This program was created with an awareness of the unique struggles of non-profits and Texas Communities to balance the budget. The program combines the power of cost savings with community development tools to make a positive impact. The Power to Make a Difference.</p>
