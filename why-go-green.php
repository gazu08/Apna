						<h3>The Power to Choose Green</h3>
							<div class="whyGo col-md-6">
								
									<p>Growing concerns on the impact to the environment and oil prices have resulted in more and 
										more people turning to the “green” alternatives. Thereʼs all this talk about green energy and 
										energy conservation. What exactly is green energy?</p>
										<h4>Why do they call it <span class="green2">“Green Energy”?</span></h4>
										<p>The alternative energy sources that are renewable, sustainable and clean are popularly known as Green Energy:</p>
										<h4><span class="green2">Renewable + Sustainable + Clean = Green Energy</span></h4>
										<p>Renewable energy occurs naturally, coming from the earth but unlike fossil fuels, can be restored very easily. 
											Similarly, an energy source is labeled as “sustainable” because it is not only restored very easy for us, 
											it will be available for many, many future generations yet to come. The energy is clean since it does 
											not pollute or harm the environment. Four of the most popular examples of green energy are:
										</p>
										
										<ul class="energyList">
											<li><span>Solar Energy:</span> The Sun: the nearest star that powers nature on earth. Just as plants derive their energy from the sun, light and heat and be used to power a variety of things from a small batteries to large factories.</li>
											<li><span>Wind Energy:</span> The days of cute aged wind mills on a quaint Dutch countryside are long gone. Modern day wind turbines of all shapes and sizes harness the kinetic energy from the wind at highly efficient rates. The result is powerful clean electricity.</li>
											<li><span>Geothermal Energy:</span> Voyage to the center of the earth! The earthʼs molten hot center naturally releases clean, thermal energy making it an excellent source of energy extracted from areas where higher activities of tectonic plates exist.</li>
											<li><span>Hydroelectric Energy:</span> Falling water is not only beautiful, itʼs a wonderful source of low cost energy. The naturally occurring gravitational force that results from flowing water is a magnificent source of energy that well planned can coexist with nature. As 70% of the earth is covered in water, it is an abundant source of green energy.</li>
										</ul>
										
										<p>So basically, as long as the sun is shining, the wind is blowing and the earth is turning, these energy sources will continue to deliver us reliable energy.</p>

								<h4> <span class="green2">Interesting Solar Energy Facts</span></h4>
								<ul class="energyList">
									<li>The first solar cell was created in the late 1880ʼs.</li>
									<li>In 1955, William Cobb from General Motors demonstrated the worldʼs first solar powered automobile. The “Sunmobile” was a 15 inch long car.</li>
									<li>The first solar powered hand held calculators sprang up in the late 1870ʼs.</li>
									<li>A solar paint is currently being developed to be painted on surfaces instead of having to install solar panels. Can you imagine spraying it on your walls?</li>
									<li>If we were to line the Sahara Desert with solar panels, it would mean 18 times the total required area to fuel the entire world.</li>
									<li>The top three states in the U.S. the most use solar power are: California (455 MW), Arizona (169 MW), North Carolina (69 MW).</li>
									<li>Itʼs no wonder that California is the largest consumer of solar power as it is home to worldʼs biggest solar power plant. The Ivanpah, located in the Mojave Desert, currently supplies electricity to approximately 200,000 homes!</li>
								</ul>
							<h4><span class="green2">Interesting Wind Energy Facts</span></h4>
							
							<ul class="energyList">
								<li>The first wind mills in history began springing up in China and Persia (present day Iran) around 200 BC.</li>
								<li>The first wind turbine to produce electricity was actually developed by James Blythe to power is holiday home in Marykirk, Scotland back in 1887.</li>
								<li>Wind energy is the number one used renewable energy power source in the world.</li>
								<li>One large wind turbine can power up to 600 homes.</li>
								<li>There is enough workable wind that sweeps across the U.S. to power ten (10) times what the country actually needs.</li>
								<li>Wind energy makes up approximately 25% of electricity that powers Texas.</li>
								<li>Wind energy is the main power supply in APNA Energyʼs Green Plans. Go Green and <a href="https://apnaenergy.isigma.net/sigma/myeaccount/?connectName=SigmaApn">Signup with APNA Energy today!</a></li>
